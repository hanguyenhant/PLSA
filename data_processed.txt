proposition means one believe true believing something true equivalent believing false one may simply idea whether true brings us agnosticism agnosticism term coined professor huxley meeting metaphysical society defined agnostic someone disclaimed strong atheism believed ultimate origin things must cause unknown unknowable thus agnostic someone believes know sure whether god exists words slippery things language inexact beware assuming work someone philosophical point view simply fact calls atheist agnostic example many people use agnosticism mean weak atheism use word atheism

logically impossible god could exist others atheists scepticism see evidence god exists impossible prove something many statement example quite simple prove exist prime number larger prime numbers course deals objects obeying rules whether gods universes similarly matter debate however assuming moment existence god provably impossible still subtle reasons assuming god assume something exist always possible show assumption invalid finding single hand assume something exist thing question provably impossible showing assumption invalid may require exhaustive search possible places thing might found show exhaustive search often impractical impossible problem largest primes prove exist therefore generally accepted must assume things exist unless evidence even theists follow rule time believe unicorns even though ca conclusively prove unicorns exist anywhere assume god exists make assumption probably tested make exhaustive search everywhere god might prove exist anywhere sceptical atheist assumes default god exist since assumption test profess strong atheism usually claim sort god exists instead generally restrict claims cover varieties god described followers various religions whilst may impossible prove conclusively god exists may possible prove say god described particular religious book exist may even possible prove god described religion exists practice believing god described religion exists close believing god exists however sufficiently different based impossibility disproving every kind god really applicable god essentially god interacts universe way effects interaction must measurable hence interaction universe must detectable god essentially must therefore case interact universe way many atheists would argue god interact universe importance whether

point digression answer question atheism religious belief depends crucially upon meant religious religion generally characterized belief superhuman controlling power especially sort god faith worship worth pointing passing varieties buddhism religion according definition atheism certainly belief sort superhuman power categorized worship meaningful sense widening definition religious encompass atheism tends result many aspects human behaviour suddenly becoming classed religious well science politics watching tv ok religion surely belief atheism science still act faith like religion firstly entirely clear sceptical atheism something one actually believes secondly necessary adopt number core beliefs assumptions make sort sense sensory data experience atheists try adopt core beliefs possible even subject questioning experience throws doubt science number core assumptions example generally assumed laws physics observers sort core assumptions atheists make basic ideas called acts faith almost everything know must said based acts faith term loses meaning faith often used refer complete certain belief something according definition atheism science certainly acts faith course individual atheists scientists dogmatic religious followers claiming something certain general tendency however many atheists would reluctant state certainty universe exists faith also used refer belief without supporting evidence proof sceptical atheism certainly fit definition sceptical atheism beliefs strong atheism closer still really match even dogmatic atheist tend refer experimental data lack asserting god exist atheism religious surely unfortunate human tendency label everyone either friend enemy truth atheism position runs logically counter theism sense said however religious believers speak atheists usually mean atheists sort antipathy hatred towards theists categorization atheists hostile towards religion quite unfair atheist attitudes towards theists fact cover broad spectrum atheists take live let live attitude unless questioned usually mention atheism except perhaps close friends course may part atheism socially acceptable many countries atheists quite may even try convert others possible historically atheists made little impact society outside eastern bloc countries digress slightly soviet union originally dedicated separation church state like usa soviet citizens legally free worship wished institution state atheism came stalin took control soviet union tried destroy churches order gain complete power population atheists quite vocal beliefs see religion encroaching matters business example government usa individuals usually concerned church state remain separate allow religion say running state surely state atheism principle separation church state state shall legislate concerning matters religious belief particular means state promote one religion expense another also promote belief religious nature religions still say discussion purely secular matters example religious believers historically responsible encouraging many political reforms even today many organizations campaigning increase spending foreign aid founded religious campaigns long campaign concerning secular matters long discriminate religious grounds atheists quite happy see say prayer schools god care people pray people pray voters lawmakers tend things pray ca ignore also christian prayer schools intimidating even told need join diversity religious belief means impossible formulate meaningful prayer acceptable present public event also tend friends family

behaviour appearance unexceptional atheists less moral religious people depends define morality obedience god course atheists less moral obey god usually one talks morality one talks acceptable right unacceptable wrong behaviour within society humans social animals maximally successful must good enough reason discourage atheists immoral behaviour purely purposes many atheists behave moral compassionate way simply feel natural tendency empathize humans care happens others know simply way naturally people behave immorally try use atheism justify actions however equally many people behave immorally try use religious beliefs justify actions example trustworthy saying deserves full acceptance jesus christ came world save sinners reason shown mercy jesus christ might display unlimited

inevitable consequence individual personality naturally sceptical person choice atheism often one makes sense hence choice person honestly make atheists want believe god atheists live lives though nobody watching many desire watched matter big brother figure might atheists would like able believe god one believe things merely one wants true risks approach obvious atheists often decide wanting believe something enough must evidence belief course atheists see evidence existence god unwilling souls see many atheists previously religious explained vast majority seriously considered possibility god exists many atheists spent time prayer trying reach god course true atheists lack open mind assuming atheists biased insincere offensive comments course god looking properly likely viewed patronizing certainly wish engage philosophical debate atheists vital give benefit doubt assume sincere say searched god willing believe basically telling truth debate futile whole life completely

concerned atheists unable believe something would otherwise believe merely makes feel comfortable put truth comfort consider searching truth sometimes makes feel unhappy hard luck atheists worry might suddenly shown wrong short answer many atheists atheists years encountered many arguments much supposed evidence existence god found invalid inconclusive thousands years religious belief resulted good proof existence god atheists therefore tend feel unlikely proved wrong immediate future stop worrying theists question beliefs arguments apply beliefs questioned similar weak atheism sceptical default

become atheists marry someone different religion real believers claimed believers sort excuse makes real believer many one true religions hard tell look christianity many competing groups convinced true christians sometimes even fight kill atheist supposed decide real christian even major christian churches like catholic church church england ca decide amongst end atheists take pragmatic view decide anyone calls christian uses christian belief dogma justify actions considered christian maybe christians perverting christian teaching ends surely bible readily used support acts ca much moral code bible word god could made less easy misinterpret know beliefs perversion god intended single unambiguous interpretation bible atheist take one interpretation another sorry someone claims believes jesus murdered others jesus bible told must call christian obviously extreme sorts beliefs questioned since nobody ever proved god exist must unlikely basic religious beliefs shared faiths nonsense hold pointed start dialogue positive assertions concerning existence entities inherently much harder disprove negative ones nobody ever proved unicorns exist make unlikely myths therefore much valid hold negative assertion default hold positive assertion default course weak atheists would argue asserting nothing better still well atheism great many theists unfortunately popularity belief little correct whether works consider many people believe astrology graphology many atheists feel simply human weakness want believe gods certainly many primitive human societies religion allows people deal phenomena adequately understand course religion industrialized world find people believing religious explanations phenomena even perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may started means attempting explain world nowadays serves purposes well many cultures developed religions surely must say something really religions superficially similar example worth remembering religions buddhism taoism lack sort concept god christian sense course religions quick denounce competing religions rather odd use one religion try justify another famous scientists philosophers concluded god exists every scientist philosopher believes god one besides already pointed truth belief determined many people believe also important realize atheists view famous scientists philosophers way theists view religious leaders famous scientist human may expert fields talks matters words carry special weight many respected scientists made look foolish speaking subjects lie outside fields expertise really
